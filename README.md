# 📊 Global Learner Insights Dashboard
# 📌 Overview

This project was completed as part of my internship at Excelerate, where I worked as a Data Analyst Associate Intern. I prepared weekly reports and built an integrated dashboard using six interconnected datasets. The goal was to provide global insights into learner journeys, covering applicants, cohorts, opportunities, and marketing campaigns.

3. [Cohort Data.csv](https://github.com/shamilshamuh/Amazon_data_analysis/blob/main/Amazon_dataset.csv) – Cohort creation, timelines, and learner size tracking

4. [Learner Opportunity Data.csv](https://github.com/shamilshamuh/Amazon_data_analysis/blob/main/Amazon_dataset.csv) – Learner applications, status, and assigned cohorts

5. [Marketing Campaign Data.csv](https://github.com/shamilshamuh/Amazon_data_analysis/blob/main/Amazon_dataset.csv) – Campaign reach, clicks, costs, and conversions
